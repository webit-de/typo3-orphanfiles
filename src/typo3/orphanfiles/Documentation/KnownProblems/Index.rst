Known problems
--------------

- Does not work with DAM file links

- Does not respect workspaces

- Will run into timeouts if working with large databases (try to narrow
  down the search)

- Does not work with FAL (since this extension was conceived for
  version 4.5)

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you find any bugs or even
better yet, send a pull request on GitHub.
